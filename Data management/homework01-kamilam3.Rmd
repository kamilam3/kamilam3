## Homework01
### Due: Monday September 13, 2021 11:59 pm US Central Time
#### Created by Course Staff

Grading Rubric (per question):  
2 points if complete and correct  
1 point if incomplete or incorrect  
0 points if no attempt made  


**Retrieving your work**

This and all future homework .md files are written in Markdown. The .md file is rendered as an .html file for easier viewing. This and all future homework assignments are located in the **homework** directory within the **stat440-sp21-course-content** repo, i.e. **stat440-sp21-course-content/homework** in GitHub. It is always recommended that you **pull** (or refresh) the **stat440-sp21-course-content** repo to ensure that you have the most updated version of all course content including the homework assignments. After pulling (or refreshing) the **stat440-sp21-course-content** repo, the homework file will be in the homework directory. Once you have accessed the .md file, copy all text from the .md file and paste all text into your reproducible document file (either .Rmd or .ipynb file). 

**Submitting your work**

In your individual student repo (named as your netID), you are to submit ***two*** files:

a. Your reproducible document file (either .Rmd or .ipynb file) which should be saved as homework##-netID.Rmd or homework##-netID.ipynb depending on your preferred software. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.Rmd.

b. Your rendered reproducible document file (.html) which should be saved as homework##-netID.html. For example, my homework 01 file would be saved as homework01-kinson2.html.

**Do not place your files in a sub-directory (or folder).** You have an unlimited number of submissions, but only the latest proper submission (commit and push) will be viewed and graded. You are allowed to only use one software language per homework file. This means that you cannot mix software languages (R and Python) in one single homework file. **Remember the .Rmd (or .ipynb) file needs to render properly to .html before submitting.** 


***

Undergraduates are expected to complete the problems **#1-#8**. Graduate students are expected to complete all problems.

**The following problems should be completed by you as an individual. If any problem asks you a particular question, be sure to answer it completely (with code, written sentences, or both). Written sentences should not appear in code chunks or code cells. Written sentences should appear in Markdown syntax unless specifically stated otherwise.**

***Do not change anything in this file above the double line. Doing so will prevent your homework from being graded.***

**#6** (Prior knowledge, Markdown) Consider the information in the image below and the image itself as a data set. Make 2 Markdown lists: one list contains 3 things you observe about the data set, and the other list contains 3 questions about the data set (i.e. things you want to know about the data).

3. Where this photo was taken?
<br>
<br>

**#7** (Prior knowledge, Markdown) Considering the image in **Problem 6** and using Markdown, create a Markdown table that shows how you would organize the data information into tabular form with at least 10 rows and at least 2 columns with column names. *Your table should have a header row that contains the column names and should be 10 rows (excluding header) and 2 columns.* 


Observation number   Objects are on the picture          Their locations on the picture  
------------------ ---------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------

**#8** (Prior knowledge, Markdown) Consider the information in the image below and the image itself as a data set. Make 2 Markdown lists: one list contains 3 things you observe about the data set, and the other list contains 3 questions about the data set (i.e. things you want to know about the data).

<br>
3 things I observed about the data set:

1. It is a white and black picture

2. Each row and each column have numbers from 1 to 9.

3. This Sudoku or table with numbers is placed on page 47. 


3 questions about the data set:

1. When was this picture released?

2. In what book or magazine this picture was published?

3. What is the aim of the picture?
<br>
<br>

**#9** (Prior knowledge, Markdown) Now, imagine that the data and information in the image in **Problem 8** could be put into tabular form (with rows and columns). What would be the field names? **You must include at least two field names.**



Row of entry    Column of entry     The number in these row and column
------------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------
       1                1                                5

       3                6                                3
       4                7                                2
       5                3                                7
       6                5                                2
       7                2                                8



**#10** (Prior knowledge, Markdown) Considering your idea for an organized tabular form of the data in **Problem 9**, describe:    

- a kind of data analysis that is sensible for this data set  

1) We can not sum each rows or each columns

2) We can not find average of each rows or each columns

3) We can not calculate standard deviation, variance of each rows or each columns

- what information is needed to help improve the data so that more analysis can be done. 

1) There is a need of providing if it is Sudoku game or not. If it is then there is a need to mention
the rules on which the Sudoku game is based.

2) There is a need of providing what these numbers mean.

3) There is a need of providing the range of numbers.

**Your answer for this problem should be written in complete sentences that follows Markdown syntax.**
